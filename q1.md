Question #1
Type Conversion: House of Cards
You and your friends are building several houses of cards. You have N cards in total.
A house of cards is like a pyramidal building.
Hence, a house of cards with a single level will be made of just two cards forming a triangle.
The one with two levels will have four cards forming two triangles at the first level, one card sitting
on top of them, and then two cards forming a triangle at the second level.
Thus, it takes 7 cards to build a house of cards with two levels.
Given your N cards, you first build the house of cards with the maximum number of levels and then
build another house with the remaining cards, and so on, until you have no cards remaining or no
more houses can be made.

Find the number of houses that can be built.

Note
You will get inputs as they are from stdin, and you will have to typecast them into the required
types.
