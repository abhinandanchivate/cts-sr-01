# ✅ **Question #2 — Type Conversion: Tower of Blocks**

You and your friends are building several **towers of blocks**.
You have **N wooden blocks** in total.

A tower is built in levels, where each level requires **L² blocks** (i.e., level 1 → 1 block, level 2 → 4 blocks, level 3 → 9 blocks, …).

So:

* A tower with **1 level** requires **1** block.
* A tower with **2 levels** requires **1 + 4 = 5** blocks.
* A tower with **3 levels** requires **1 + 4 + 9 = 14** blocks.
* A tower with **4 levels** requires **1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30** blocks.

You must build towers as follows:

1. Always build the **tallest possible** tower with the blocks you currently have.
2. Then repeat with the **remaining blocks**.
3. Stop when you can't build even a 1-level tower.

Find the **number of towers** that can be built.

---

# 📥 **Input Format**

A single integer **N**, the number of blocks.

### Sample Input

```
40
```

---

# 📤 **Output Format**

A single integer → the number of towers that can be built.

### Sample Output

```
2
```

---

# 📘 **Explanation**

With **40 blocks**:

* The tallest tower you can build is **4 levels → needs 30 blocks**
  Remaining = 40 − 30 = **10**
* Next tallest:

  * 3 levels → needs 14 blocks (cannot)
  * 2 levels → needs 5 blocks
    Remaining = 10 − 5 = **5**
* Next:

  * 2 levels → needs 5 blocks
    Remaining = 5 − 5 = **0**

Total towers = **2**

# 🧮 **Formula Reference**

Blocks needed for a tower of L levels:

```
blocks(L) = 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + L² = (L * (L + 1) * (2L + 1)) / 6
```
